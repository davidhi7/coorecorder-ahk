# CooRecorder-ahk
CooRecorder is a program used for measuring tree ring widths.
However, the program suffers from badly implemented controls, which is what this script attempts to improve using AutoHotkey.
This script was tested with CooRecorder 9.6.3.

## Introduced keybindings
* Mousewheel Up/Down: Scroll up and down when hovering over the picture
* Mousewheel Left/Right: Scroll left and right when hovering over the picture. Requires a mouse with left / right scrolling functionality.
* Ctrl + Mousewheel Up/Down: Zoom in and out
* Home, End keys: Go to the top or bottom of the picture, respectively

## Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
